North Campus dorms (Old East, Old West, Spencer, Alderman) are historical and located adjacent to academic buildings and Davis Library. They tend to be quieter and are preferred by students who want close access to classes and library resources.

Many North Campus buildings are corridor-style and may have older amenities, but their proximity to Franklin Street and campus centers makes them ideal for students prioritizing location and study environments.
