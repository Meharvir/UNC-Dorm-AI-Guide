# Craige North Hall Reviews (Roomsurf)

August L. (10/24/23, 3.3/5): “overall good, the halls are sometimes noisy but better than most dorms on campus. the rooms are really big in comparison to other buildings. the building is suite style throughout. the elevator is kind of slow.”

Daniel M. (03/30/21, 4.6/5): “Craige North is a great dorm to be at. It is large, nice, new, and clean. My only issue … is that it tends not to be a social dorm. … I had a much nicer room … but I did not become nearly as close … as some other people did in other dorms.”
