# Avery Hall Reviews (Roomsurf)

Cameron C. (02/21/21, 4.4/5): “Great location and perfect balance of social and quiet. I lived on the fourth floor and it was a lot of flights of stairs so that is a downside. It is a dorm that is home to many athletes so if you are a non-athlete that could be fun.”

Verified Resident (12/03/20, 4.1/5): “Due to the Covid 19 virus, my stay at Avery Hall … was quite an experience. … sharing the laundry room. Someone left some bleach in the washer … limited number of working dryers … repairs took longer than normal. … I would highly recommend every student live in a dorm their first year …”
