# Teague Hall Reviews (Roomsurf)

Khira R. (12/15/20, 4.2/5): “Teague is a pretty nice dorm. The rooms are spacious and there aren't many people who live there so it is a pretty quiet dorm. The basement of Teague is also really spacious and fun, its a good place to just chill or do homework. The worst thing … is that there is no laundry room so you have to go next door to either Carmichael or Parker, also the vending machines kind of suck.”
