# Spencer Hall Reviews (Roomsurf)

Austin L. (10/16/23, 3.8/5): “I have had a mediocre experience in Spencer Residence Hall. The bathrooms are, for the most part, clean — janitors clean them Monday through Friday in the mornings. The common areas are typically quiet and a great place to relax.”

Sam T. (01/25/21, 4.2/5): “I lived in Spencer Hall for two years and would highly recommend it … It is convenient to classes, Franklin Street, and … athletic facilities. My room was a bit smaller … but … very reliable heat and AC. … My room also overlooked the arboretum … great spot to hang with friends … The best amenities … are the gracious common areas. … made living in a smaller dorm room … much more bearable.”
