# Ehringhaus Hall Reviews (Roomsurf)

Vishnu P. (09/09/23, 4.1/5): “Overall, Ehringhaus Residence was a great dorm to live in. I met some of my closest friends there, thanks to the great community created by the Resident Advisors. … plenty of space for students, complete with a full kitchen and study lounges on each floor. … there was even a gaming room … maintenance was quick to resolve any issues.”

Dwayne H. (02/06/21, 4.1/5): “Sharing a bathroom with seven other men was not the most ideal situation, but … having access to this many people during my first year was beneficial. … The location on campus is ideal for first years who want to make friends with others in neighboring dorms.”

Mary Grace C. (03/06/21, 4.4/5): “It was okay. The rooms are crazy small, but the fact you don’t have to share a bathroom with an entire hall of people is nice. … The only major issues … are the distance to classes and the fact the lounges … need to be updated.”

Verified Resident (10/26/20, 4.8/5): “Ehringhaus Hall … is on South Campus, so it’s a bit of a walk to campus. But the rooms are pretty nice and everything’s kept pretty clean. It was nice to have a piano in the mail room.”

William K. (12/02/20, 1.9/5): “If I could describe the dorm in a word, that word would be ‘dull’. Cinderblock walls, cheap plastic-covered mattresses, industrial-esque bathrooms, rooms only slightly big enough … Ehaus had all the dorm clichés.”

Lesly G. (11/04/20, 4.1/5): “Ehaus is a very old dorm but for its age its in pretty good shape. … when it starts getting cold your bathroom is also cold unless they turn on the heating system.”
