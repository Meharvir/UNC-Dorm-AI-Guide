South Campus dorms (Hinton James / HoJo, Craige, Morrison, Hardin) are newer and often feature suite-style living and central air conditioning. These dorms are popular with freshmen and are known for social activity and modern amenities.

South Campus is farther from some academic buildings on North Campus but closer to athletic facilities and large dining halls, making it convenient for students who value modern comforts and community life.
