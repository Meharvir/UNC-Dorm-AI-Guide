Hinton James (HoJo) is one of the largest residence halls at UNC and is well-known for its active freshman community. It offers suite-style rooms and many on-site common areas used for social events and floor activities.

Because of its size and social culture, Hinton James can be less quiet than some North Campus dorms, but it offers convenience to South Campus dining and recreation.
