# Horton Hall Reviews (Roomsurf)

Avery B. (10/17/23, 4.6/5): “This building is the closest to the center of campus. This is known as the social dorm and it is super easy to meet people and make friends! Each floor has a lounge area with couches that feels like a mini living room!”

Maylin C. (09/06/23, 4.7/5): “As a freshman, I am pleasantly surprised by the dorm experience I have had. Horton is a smaller dorm building with bigger living space. The lounges are clean and comfortable. The laundry room is functional and has an appropriate number of machines.”
